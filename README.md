# Determine-the-opening-of-the-jaw
An application implemented as part of the subject telemedicine. Its purpose is to determine the degree of mouth opening in real time on the image captured from the webcam built into the laptop for diagnostic purposes. The system allows you to track the movement of the mandible during a simple exercise when the patient sits in front of the camera and alternately closes and opens his mouth. Knowledge about the degree of opening will be part of the diagnostic information along with parallel recorded signals from other modalities.
